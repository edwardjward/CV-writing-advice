<h2>Tips about preparing your CV for your first Junior Developer job
  
There is no secret sauce to writing a CV, no standard format and no rules you must apply. But, there are guidelines that certain industries and job roles would prefer to see followed on your CV, or at least guidelines that will help you get into their heads and make them want to meet you. 

Writing a CV is as much a psychological game as it is a story of your career. It’s psychological because you are essentially selling yourself off a piece of paper, you have to make the readers time count, more often than not, whilst competing against others who may be in a stronger position than you.
