# Prepare your CV for a Junior Developer job

There is no secret sauce to writing a CV, no standard format and no rules you absolutely must apply. But, there are guidelines that certain industries and job roles would prefer to see followed on your CV, or at least guidelines that will help you get into their heads and make them want to meet you.

Writing a CV is as much a psychological game as it is a story of your career. It’s psychological because you are essentially selling yourself from a piece of paper, you have to make the readers time count, and don't forget, you need to stand out from others competing for the same job.

So please take time writing your CV.  Like a web product, you feel it's never perfect, but get the basics right and things should start working for you. In this instance we’re going to look at preparing your CV specifically for a **Junior Developer** position having just finished Le Wagon. You can start applying for jobs from week 7 and we are seeing an increasing amount of students getting interviews and even job offers before the end of the batch. **Believe in yourself, you are a full-stack developer now!**

# Lets Go

A great CV will improve your chances of getting interviews much faster. **Nail the first half page!** Your first half page, or more, needs to stand out with the right information to hook the reader and leave them thinking *“I really want to interview this candidate”*. So clearly this is going to be filled with the most relevant information regarding a job as a Junior Developer...your bootcamp, tech skills, projects and any other coding expreience.

# Best Practices and Guidelines

### Keep it tidy
Use headings and highlight key words with **bold** or _italics_. Use the space efficiently and don’t cram too much in. It’s good to the leave the reader asking questions about you as well, they'll want to make contact. 

### Keep it Concise
According to the recruitment industry the average CV reading time is 6 seconds. **MAKE THE READER'S TIME COUNT!** Two sides max. One side better. Use bullets points or hyphens to separate important info from waffle.

Don’t waffle! In a snapshot, your core strengths should stand out.

### Make it targeted and keyword friendly
Tailor your CV to the job so keywords jump out at the reader. The job description will highlight key skills they want, so **bold** them, or *italic* them, bullet them. This is the psychological game. **Mention Ruby or Javascript loads**, or both loads, depending on the job role. You’re getting into their heads even more. If you’re applying to a Python job, mention Python a lot. Get Python standing out frequently across your CV. Also jobs board have machines that read your CV, so keywords matter.

### Be confident
Write with flair and be bold. Don’t be arrogant but do talk about your achievements. Remember you are trying to sell yourself after all.

# Structure and Design

Before you read further through the different sections and topics of a CV, please [take a look at these CVs here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TcOOXU-fQxib3WzJQnm8tPpTMAY-jK3o?usp=sharing). These are real CVs from alumni but we have made changes to show false information for rights reasons. Take some time now to study the content, the keyword repetition, styling, layout and design. You will see two CVs that are pretty bland with zero design. The reason these are listed here is to prove that having the right content is the most important aspect. These two students received multiple interview requests within days of searching for jobs and secured jobs very, very quickly. It's not all down design. 

### When looking at the CVs, observe the following:

* See how the personal summary is factual
* The first half page or more is all about their coding experience
* Technical Keywords such as Ruby and Javascript are mentioned multiple times
* There’s clarity to the design, easy to read
* No waffle, to the point

### BEWARE: DO NOT COPY OR REPLICATE THESE CVS.
The reason is that you will most likely come up against other Le Wagon alumni from your batch or another batch going for the same job. If there’s a CV clash for a job vacancy the reader will immediately smell laziness from both of you. So start from scratch and be yourself.


<p></p>There are endless CV designs out there and even the most basic looking CVs with absolutely zero personality, but the right content, can be really effective. But try to work on the styling if you can. It shows you care and you’ve taken some time to make the reader’s experience a bit more enjoyable. By that, we don’t mean you have to design something crazy in Sketch, it can still be in simple Word or Pages format if you like, but make sure the layout and design is easy to read and easy on the eye.

You will be up against other people for these jobs, so at least make some effort on the structure and design.

## Lets look at the structure and order of topics

### Personal Details
Include first name, last name, phone number, email address, GithHub and Linked In. Some people don't like to put their actual address and prefer to just reference their City, or City and Zip Code. Keep your Github clean. These days there’s no need to include your date of birth or a photo.

### Personal Summary
<p>At the beginning of a CV you are most likely to find a small paragraph of 2 or 3 sentences outlining your core strengths that highlight key skills, experience and character traits.</p>


Either make it punchy or don’t have one at all. _“I am motivated and work well in a team”_. Anyone can say that. So back it up with fact. _“Having worked in the financial services industry for 2 years I’ve managed teams to deliver projects under strict and high-pressured conditions where quality, team-work and time management are critical”._ Here we have hard facts.

### Technical Skills
Some people like to include their technical skills under their Personal Summary, and others at the bottom or down the side in a so called column. List these skills early. Get these words jumping out at the reader: **RUBY, RAILS, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT** etc. Don’t rank yourself in each skillset, like *Ruby - beginner*, or *Ruby - 3 / 5*. Just don’t. No point putting yourself in a box.

### Experience
If you have just finished school or university and have little to no work experience, keep reading this section, there’s some advice further down under the heading **If you have little to no previous experience**.

<p></p>
Some people like to split the *Experience* section into 2 parts.

1) **Relevant Experience**,
2) either **Other Experience, Employment, or Professional Experience**.

Others like to simply list everything under *Experience*, inlcuding Le Wagon, projects, employment. As you wish.

Splitting it makes sense since you’ve just graduated from a coding a bootcamp. Le Wagon and your projects is the most relevant experience when applying for a junior developer role. Let’s take a look.

**1) Relevant Experience**

Under this title you can list that you have just attended Le Wagon and also any other coding courses or qualifications you may have. For example:

> **Le Wagon London | Ruby on Rails Coding Bootcamp | London | Oct - Dec 2018**
>9 weeks, on-site, 10 hours a day coding bootcamp learning Ruby on **Rails, HTML5, CSS/Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, PostgreSQL, MVC architecture, OOP, git, GitHub, and Heroku**

And under this you can also list your **“Web Development Projects”** or just **“Projects”**. As you wish.

### Web Development Projects
In the last 3 weeks of Le Wagon you’ll build an Air Bnb Project and your final project. Not only do you have 2 real apps to show here, but again you can list more keywords and show you’ve worked in a team. Feel free to bold or italic the keywords depending on the design and styling of your CV. For Example:
<p></p>

> **On Top** - a multiplayer tennis tournament generation app: built with **JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Ajax, HTML and CSS**  whilst also working as a team on **Github/Heroku**.

You also have other projects if you need to fill space:

* Mister Cocktail
* Landing page / personal website
* Food Delivery
* Cookbook

All these projects above can take a description of some sort followed by keywords. Maybe choose your top 3 to save space.

Part of the psychological game is listing. A list tells someone you’ve done a lot of projects. They don’t even have to read much because subconsciously there’s a lovely list in front of them with all these cool projects and great **keywords**.

**2) Professional Experience / Other Experience / Employment**

From here on you can revert back to the more conventional CV format. This is where you will actually start listing your work experience and / or previous jobs. People like to refer to it with various headings, such as **Professional Experience, Emlpoyment or even just Other Experience**.

If you’re keeping your CV to one page then you might want to list your experience just by company name, job title, city and date. *Instead* of going deeper into your roles within each job. It looks slicker this way and there’s less waffle and clutter on your CV. Unless of course all your previous experience is relevant to the job you’re applying to. So if you are applying to a fintech dev role and you’ve worked in a few finance based jobs, your role descriptions are most probably very relevant.

### If you have little to no previous experience

That’s fine. The great thing about the coding industry and finding your first developer job is that everyone is junior, regardless of any previous work experience. And as you know, people are of varying coding abilities and what ultimately matters is how good you are at coding. Not how many years experience you have working in a professional or commercial environment. 

However, having experience does help. But if you’ve got little to none, list the little experience you do have. Whether it be bar, hotel or restaurant work. It shows you’ve got at least some team, client and commercial experience to some extent. If you have absolutely none at all, don’t worry, in most cases that’s understandable and you’ve probably just left school or university. It gives you a really good reason to code on other projects and continue working on your existing ones.

And going back to one of the first points made in this article, **your first half page is what really matters: your coding experience.**

### Education / Hobbies / Volunteer Work

Exactly where you list education on your CV can really depend on what education you have. For example, if you studied Maths at Oxford and got a top grade, or went to Buisiness School, have an MBA or a Masters, shout about it. And if your academic strenghths lie in engineering, finance, sciences, software, Computer Science, programming etc, tell them about it early on your CV. In this instance you can list your education at the top of your CV under your personal summary. High profile academic qualifications matter. As you know, coding is tough and it requires brain power and endless learning, so if you have facts to prove, brag about it. But if you think your education isn’t that relevant, then list it at the bottom of your CV to save space at the top for more immediately relevant info. 

Hobbies and volunteer work show a snapshot of your character and who you are. These sections really aren’t essential if you’re trying to save space, but if you can squeeze them in, they say a lot about someone and do no harm at all.

### Conclusion 

This should really help you prepare your CV for your first Junior Developer job application. Try to follow these guidelines if you can. We have seen a noticable increase in job interviews by adopting these techniques. 

Aside from the CV writing, remember that you are full stack developers now and you are worth money! Be confident and bold and keep applying for jobs. **Also remember to keep coding! Keep your Github green!**
